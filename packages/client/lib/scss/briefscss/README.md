# BriefCSS

BreifCSS is a CSS framework built for me and my personal projects.

Like Bulma, Brief is designed with readable CSS classes and sensible code
design in mind. Brief uses no JS components. However, Brief opts for different
design choices (no `is-danger`, just `is-red`). Furthermore, the code is more
programmatically generated than Bulma, making it, in some senses, more
customizable.

Ultimately, Brief attempts to trim the fat of larger CSS projects while also
allowing developers to add touches of their own more easily on top of what
already exists.

It remains practically unusable right now for anyone except me due to its lack
of documentation, but fear not, it is coming soon.
